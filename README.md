This is a fork of WorldguardExtraFlags

Original plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldguard-extra-flags.4823/

Original plugin source: https://github.com/aromaa/WorldGuardExtraFlagsPlugin


This fork was created because https://www.spigotmc.org/members/chevels.51212/ commissioned it. It was shared with both her and mine permission to help the community.
It may or may not be updated in the future, however, its likely to be compatible with future spigot versions.

This fork of WorldguardExtraFlags has the following changes:
- Updated worldguard extra flags to use java 16 dependencies to support 1.17
- Re-Activated the flags allow-block-place & deny-block-place and fixed an issue with them.
- Added two flags:
ALLOW_ENTITY_PLACE
DENY_ENTITY_PLACE
(Entity equivalent to the block allow and deny flags) 

This fork may not be compatible with older versions of spigot / worldguard /worldedit /protocol lib

Have a nice day!
